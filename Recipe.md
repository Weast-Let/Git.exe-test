Preheat oven to 175Â°C, and grease and line a 500g / 1lb loaf tin.

This recipe can be made either by the traditional creaming method, or with the all in one, blitz and bake method.

Traditional:
Cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy.
Beat in the vanilla essence and eggs gradually, and adding flour as needed to reduce curdling.
Mix in the flour and cocoa powder in stages, adding the plant milk a little at a time as needed to prevent the mixture becoming too stiff.  (Avoid adding too much if using chocolate chips, if the batter is too slack, they sink to the bottom during cooking.)
Mix in chocolate chips.

Blitz and bake:
Put all of the ingredients except chocolate chips and plant milk into a food processor, and blitz until fully combined, adding some of the plant milk if the mixture is too stiff.
Stir in the chocolate chips, adding more plant milk if needed.

Both:
Tip cake batter into prepared loaf tin.  For a less domed top, gently create a well in the centre of the mixture before putting into the oven.
Bake for about 35-40 minutes, until there is firm sping back when the surface is gently pressed.

The mixture can also be used to make 10-12 muffin sized cakes, taking about 15-18 minutes to bake.
